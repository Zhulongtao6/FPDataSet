PBN Flight Procedure Dataset for research on intelligent flight procedure design. The data source is AIP, with the original data in PDF format. It has been converted to JSON format using a large language model. Currently, it includes over 40 departure procedures from Shuangliuï¼Œtianfu and Jiangbei airports, covering more than 300 flight segments.
The code for AutoFPDesigner, trained using the above data, will be released soon. For more information about AutoFPDesigner, please refer to:
